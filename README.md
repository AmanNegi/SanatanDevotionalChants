# Sanatan Devotional Chants

Sanatan Devotional Chant is an app that aims to preserve and promote the rich cultural heritage of India by providing a platform to access various mantras, bhajans, and aartis with lyrics and audio. In today's fast-paced world, we are gradually forgetting our roots and cultural values, and this app seeks to bridge that gap.

Most similar apps available in the market either come with bloated ads or are paid, providing a bad user experience. Sanatan Devotional Chant, on the other hand, is a completely free app that offers an ad-free and seamless experience to its users. Our goal is to make devotional music and prayers accessible to everyone without any hindrances, enabling users to immerse themselves in the spiritual experience. With Sanatan Devotional Chant, we hope to inspire people to connect with their roots and find solace in the divine realm.

Sanatan Devotional Chant is not only a free and ad-free app but also an open-source application. We believe that everyone should have access to the source code and contribute towards this noble cause. We welcome all contributions from the community, be it adding new features, improving the user experience, or simply fixing bugs.

Our mission is to create a platform that promotes and preserves the cultural and spiritual heritage of India, and we believe that open-source development is the way to achieve this goal. With everyone's contribution, we can make Sanatan Devotional Chant a comprehensive and versatile platform that caters to the needs of everyone. So, let's join hands and work together towards this noble cause.
